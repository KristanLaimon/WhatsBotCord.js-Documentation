**_WhatsBotCord_** is a lightweight, TypeScript-based library for building WhatsApp bots with a Discord-inspired command system (e.g., **!yourcommand**, **@everyone**, and _more_). Built as a wrapper around Baileys.js, it abstracts complex Baileys.js internals, providing an intuitive, type-safe interface for managing WhatsApp groups and individual chats. Designed from developers to developers to create custom bots with ease.

## Features

- 🤖 **Discord-Inspired Command System**: Create commands (e.g., !hello) with a simple, familiar syntax inspired by Discord bots.
- 🔵 **TypeScript Support**: Fully typed with TypeScript for robust development and autocompletion.
- ✨ **Simplified Baileys Wrapper**: Abstracts complex Baileys internals, making it easy to manage groups, individual senders, and message handling.
- 💬 **Group and Individual Messaging**: Seamlessly interact with WhatsApp groups and individual chats.
- 🧩 **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design for adding custom commands and functionality.
- 🚀 **Lightweight and Performant**: Optimized for speed and efficiency if using Bun.js (optional).

## Installation

```shell
npm install whatsbotcord
```

or

```shell
bun i whatsbotcord
```

- **_WhatsApp Account_**: You NEED an active WhatsApp account on a mobile device to scan a QR code for Web Device Login (not an official WhatsApp Business API).

## Getting started

Import the library and you can use this minimal code to get started with your first command:

### Javascript

```js
import Whatsbotcord, { CommandType } from "whatsbotcord";

const bot = new Whatsbotcord({
  commandPrefix: "!",
  tagCharPrefix: "@",
  credentialsFolder: "./auth",
  loggerMode: "recommended",
});
bot.Commands.Add(
  {
    name: "ping",
    async run(chat, api, commandArgs) {
      await chat.SendText("pong!");
    },
  },
  CommandType.Normal
);
bot.Start();
```

### Typescript

```ts
import Whatsbotcord, { type AdditionalAPI, type CommandArgs, type IChatContext, CommandType } from "whatsbotcord";

const bot = new Whatsbotcord({
  commandPrefix: "!",
  tagCharPrefix: "@",
  credentialsFolder: "./auth",
  loggerMode: "recommended",
});
bot.Commands.Add(
  {
    name: "ping",
    async run(chat: IChatContext, _api: AdditionalAPI, _commandArgs: CommandArgs): Promise<void> {
      await chat.SendText("pong!");
    },
  },
  CommandType.Normal
);
bot.Start();
```

## More advanced usage

The last example is the easiest way to start, but commonly you will be using
the following workflow when working with them. It shows a little more advance usage and
a basic showcase what this library has to offer.

Here it's creating a simple command that accepts an img, validates its sent from the user, and send it back if
it is valid.

### Javascript

```js
import Whatsbotcord, { CommandType, CreateCommand, MsgType } from "whatsbotcord";

// ================== Ping.js ======================
const pingCommand = CreateCommand(
  "ping",
  async (ctx, api, args) => {
    await ctx.SendText("Pong!");
  },
  { aliases: "p" }
);
export default pingCommand;

// ========================== MAIN ==============================
//import pingCommand from "./Ping.js";
const bot = new Whatsbotcord({
  //Can accept an array of prefixes or only one "!" prefix
  commandPrefix: ["$", "!", "/"],
  tagCharPrefix: ["@"],
  credentialsFolder: "./auth",
  loggerMode: "recommended",
});
//1. You can add commands by just instatiating them or...
bot.Commands.Add(pingCommand, CommandType.Normal);
//2. By declaring them directly on 'Add' method
bot.Commands.Add(
  {
    name: "forwardmsg",
    description: "A simple description for my forwardmsg",
    aliases: ["f"], //You can use !forwardmsg or !f in chat, they are the same!
    async run(chat, api, args) {
      /**
       * If user uses !forwardmsg argument1 argument2 @someone, this will be ["argument1", "argument2", "@someone]
       * otherwise, will be a [] (empty array) if no args provided
       */
      const commandArgs = args.args;
      await chat.Loading(); ///Sends an ⌛ reaction emoji to original msg that triggered this command
      await chat.SendText("Send me a image:");
      const imgReceived = await chat.WaitMultimedia(MsgType.Image, { timeoutSeconds: 60, wrongTypeFeedbackMsg: "Hey, send me an img, try again!" });
      //If user has sent the expected msg of type img, this will be a buffer
      if (imgReceived) {
        await chat.SendText("I've received your img, Im going to send it back");
        /* -> */ await chat.SendImgFromBufferWithCaption(imgReceived, ".png", "Im a caption");
        //OR
        /* -> */ await chat.SendImgFromBuffer(imgReceived, ".png");
        await chat.Ok(); //Sends a ✅ reaction emoji to original msg
        //Otherwise, its null
      } else {
        await chat.SendText("I didn't get your msg... End of command");
        await chat.Fail(); //Sends a ❌ reaction emoji to original msg
      }
    },
  },
  CommandType.Normal
);
bot.Start();
```

### Typescript

```ts
import Whatsbotcord, { type AdditionalAPI, type ChatContext, type CommandArgs, type IChatContext, type ICommand, CommandType, MsgType } from "whatsbotcord";

// ================== Ping.ts ======================
// A command can be created with a class implementing ICommand
class PingCommand implements ICommand {
  name: string = "ping";
  description: string = "replies with pong!";
  aliases: string[] = ["p"];
  async run(chat: ChatContext, _api: AdditionalAPI, _commandArgs: CommandArgs): Promise<void> {
    await chat.SendText("Pong!");
  }
}
export default PingCommand;

// ========================== MAIN ==============================
const bot = new Whatsbotcord({
  //Can accept an array of prefixes or only one "!" prefix
  commandPrefix: ["$", "!", "/"],
  tagCharPrefix: ["@"],
  credentialsFolder: "./auth",
  loggerMode: "recommended",
});
//1. You can add commands by just instatiating them or...
bot.Commands.Add(new PingCommand(), CommandType.Normal);
//2. By declaring them directly on Add method
bot.Commands.Add(
  {
    name: "forwardmsg",
    aliases: ["f"], //You can use !forwardmsg or !f, they are the same!
    async run(chat: IChatContext, _api: AdditionalAPI, _args: CommandArgs) {
      /**
       * If user uses !forwardmsg argument1 argument2 @someone, this will be ["argument1", "argument2", "@someone]
       * otherwise, will be a [] (empty array) if no args provided
       */
      // const commandArgs: string[] = args.args;
      await chat.Loading(); ///Sends an ⌛ reaction emoji to original msg that triggered this command
      await chat.SendText("Send me a image:");
      const imgReceived = await chat.WaitMultimedia(MsgType.Image, {
        timeoutSeconds: 60,
        wrongTypeFeedbackMsg: "Hey, send me an img, try again!",
        cancelKeywords: ["cancelcustomword"],
      });
      //If user has sent the expected msg of type img, this will be a buffer
      if (imgReceived) {
        await chat.SendText("I've received your img, Im going to send it back");
        /* -> */ await chat.SendImgFromBufferWithCaption(imgReceived, ".png", "Im a caption");
        //OR
        /* -> */ await chat.SendImgFromBuffer(imgReceived, ".png");
        await chat.Ok(); //Sends a ✅ reaction emoji to original msg
        //Otherwise, its null
      } else {
        await chat.SendText("I didn't get your msg... End of command");
        await chat.Fail(); //Sends a ❌ reaction emoji to original msg
      }
    },
  },
  CommandType.Normal
);
bot.Start();
```

# Cancelling long commands

If you have long-running command workflows, users can cancel them using specific
**cancel words**, by default are "cancel" (english) and "cancelar" (spanish).

Let's say you are using the last example !forwardmsg. Bot is expecting from you to send him a
image msg, but if you want to cancel it (don't want to send it anymore), just send to bot
'cancel' and command will immediately abort.

## **Global Config**

You can configure what words to use as _cancel words_ from Bot constructor config.

```js
const bot = new WhatsbotCord({
  commandPrefix: ["$", "!", "/", "."],
  credentialsFolder: "./auth",
  loggerMode: "recommended",
  delayMilisecondsBetweenMsgs: 1,
  cancelKeywords: ["my", "cancel", "words"], //Here
});
// ... more code
```

## **Local Config**

You can override temporaly just for a "Wait\*()" method which _cancel words_ to use.

```js
const imgReceived = await chat.WaitMultimedia(MsgType.Image, {
  timeoutSeconds: 60,
  wrongTypeFeedbackMsg: "Hey, send me an img, try again!",
  cancelKeywords: ["cancelcustomword"],
});
```

Here, this method will use only \["cancelcustomword"].
But if you use another WaitMultimedia(...) or WaitMsg(...) method, it'll fallback to global config from bot, in
this case will be: ["my", "cancel", "words"]

## Plugins

Of course, you can use plugins to improve dynamically your bot,
either imported from other libraries or official ones.

### One user per command - Plugin \[Official]

Normally, if you use **_!yourcommand_** and its a long process command,
users can send again **_!yourcommand_** (or any other) in chat while the first one
is executing, leading to unexpected behavior.

Of course,
maybe your use case doesn't need it. But, if you need to validate
this, you can use the following pluggin developed officially
from this library.

#### Javascript And Typescript

```js
import WhatsbotCord, { OfficialPlugin_OneCommandPerUserAtATime } from "whatsbotcord";

const bot = new WhatsbotCord({
  /** bot config */
});
/** your commands here with bot.Commands.Add(...) */
bot.Use(
  OfficialPlugin_OneCommandPerUserAtATime({
    msgToSend: (info, lastCommand, actualCommand) => {
      return `
      You can't use !${actualCommand.name}. Wait until finish that last command ${lastCommand.name}`;
    },
    timeoutSecondsToForgetThem: 60 * 5,
  })
);
```

## Usage with group data and tags

You can use commands and make them usable as **_Tags_**, which are called with '@' by default. You can change this
in _tagCharPrefix_ property option when creating your Bot option.

Here this command recreates the famous @everyone command from Discord!

## Javascript

```js
import Bot, { CommandType, CreateCommand } from "whatsbotcord";

const everyoneTag = CreateCommand(
  //Will be used as @everyone
  "everyone",
  async (chat, api, args) => {
    const res = await chat.FetchGroupData();
    if (res) {
      /**
       *  In this case is easy, res comes with res.members which is an array of all members with their
       *  respective ID ready to quote them in msg and send. This is abstracted
       *  thanks to this library!
       */
      const mentions = res.members.map((m) => m.asMentionFormatted);
      const ids = res.members.map((m) => m.rawId);
      await chat.SendText(mentions.join(" "), { mentionsIds: ids });
    }
  },
  //So it can be used like @e
  { aliases: "e" }
);

// ========================== MAIN ==============================
const bot = new Bot({
  commandPrefix: ["$", "!", "/"],
  tagCharPrefix: ["@"],
  credentialsFolder: "./auth",
  loggerMode: "recommended",
});
/** Important, must be with CommandType.Tag prop to work */
bot.Commands.Add(everyoneTag, CommandType.Tag);
bot.Start();

/**
 * Now on whatsapp when someone sends a msg txt "@everyone" or "@e" the
 * command will be executed. (Of course, the bot must be part of that group
 * in first place to even be able to respond)
 */
```

## Typescript

```ts
import type { AdditionalAPI, ChatContext, CommandArgs, ICommand } from "whatsbotcord";
import Bot, { CommandType } from "whatsbotcord";

class EveryoneTag implements ICommand {
  name: string = "e";
  aliases: string[] = ["test"];
  async run(chat: ChatContext, _api: AdditionalAPI, _args: CommandArgs): Promise<void> {
    const res = await chat.FetchGroupData();
    if (res) {
      /**
       *  In this case is easy, res comes with res.members which is an array of all members with their
       *  respective @23423423 formatted mention and ID 234234234@lid ready to send. This is abstracted
       *  thanks to this library!
       */
      const mentions = res.members.map((m) => m.asMentionFormatted!);
      const ids = res.members.map((m) => m.rawId!);
      await chat.SendText(mentions.join(" "), { mentionsIds: ids });
    }
  }
}

// ========================== MAIN ==============================
const bot = new Bot({
  commandPrefix: ["$", "!", "/"],
  tagCharPrefix: ["@"],
  credentialsFolder: "./auth",
  loggerMode: "recommended",
});
bot.Commands.Add(new EveryoneTag(), CommandType.Tag);
bot.Start();

/**
 * Now on whatsapp when someone sends a msg txt "@everyone" or "@e" the
 * command will be executed. (Of course, the bot must be part of that group
 * in first place to even be able to respond)
 */
```

# Events

Bot actually have a list of curated events you can subscribe to:

```js
const bot = new Bot({
  /** your config ***/
});
bot.Events.onGroupEnter.Subscribe((groupMetadata: GroupMetadata) => {
  /** do something with groupMetadata */
});
bot.Events.onCommandNotFound.Subscribe((ctx: IChatContext, commandNameStrNotFound: string) => {
  ctx.SendText("Coudn't find " + commandNameStrNotFound + "!. Try again");
});
//And more bot.Events.*****!
```

Which can be one of the following:

- **_onGroupEnter_**: Pretty self-explanatory
- **_onGroupUpdate_**: When a group updates its name, descripcion or members count.
- **_onIncomingMsg_**: When a msg arrives. It's the most raw way to get a msg from whatsapp.
- **_onRestart_**: When bot restarting itself in case of error reconnection.
- **_onSentMessage_**: After sending a msg
- **_onStartupAllGroupsIn_**: Pretty self-explanatory
- **_onUpdateMsg_**: When receiving updates like "emoji reactions" on already sent emojis, etc...
- **_onCommandNotFound_**: If user tries a command that doesn't exist, this will be executed.
- **_onMiddlewareEnd_**: Will be executed after all middleware layers are executed successfully if any added. See [Middleware](#middleware) for more info.
- **_onCommandFound_**: It's called when user uses a valid !command and its found, but not yet executed.
- **_onCommandFoundAfterItsExecution_**: It's called after a valid !command has been executed (either successfully or not)

# Middleware

Your bot supports optional middleware, similar to how it works in popular libraries like [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express). There are two types of middleware you can use.

## 1. General Middleware (`bot.Use()`)

This is the main middleware that runs on **every** raw incoming message, not checking if its valid command or not.

- Middlewares are executed in the order they are added.
- Each middleware receives the full context of the incoming message and decides whether to continue the chain by calling `next()`.

You can use this for features that need to inspect all traffic, such as:

- Global logging and analytics
- Rate limiting / spam protection
- Blocking users across the entire bot

```ts
const bot = new WhatsbotCord({
  commandPrefix: ["$", "!", "/", "."],
  tagPrefix: ["@"],
  credentialsFolder: "./auth",
});

// Add a general middleware for logging
bot.Use((bot, senderId_LID, senderId_PN, chatId, rawMsg, msgType, senderType, next) => {
  // ✅ This code will run for EVERY message
  console.log(`Incoming message from ${senderId_LID} in ${chatId}`);

  // Continue to the next middleware (or to command handling)
  next();
});
```

---

## 2. Command-Specific Middleware (`bot.Use_OnCommandFound()`)

This is a more targeted middleware that runs **only after a valid command is found**, but _before_ that command's `run` method is executed. This applies either for tags or commands as well.

This makes it the perfect place for logic that should only apply to commands, such as:

- **Permission Checks**: Is the user an admin? Do they have the right role?
- **Command-Specific Logging**: Tracking who uses which command.
- **Cooldowns**: Preventing a user from spamming a specific command.

The function signature is similar to the general middleware but includes an extra `commandFound` parameter, which is the command object that is about to be executed.

```ts
// Register a command that should be admin-only
bot.Commands.Add(
  {
    name: "ban",
    async run(ctx) {
      await ctx.SendText("Banning user...");
    },
  },
  CommandType.Normal
);

// Add a command-specific middleware for permission checks
bot.Use_OnCommandFound(async (bot, senderId_LID, senderId_PN, chatId, rawMsg, msgType, senderType, commandFound, next) => {
  const admins = ["admin1@s.whatsapp.net", "admin2@s.whatsapp.net"];

  // ✅ This code will ONLY run if a valid command is found

  // Check if the command is 'ban' and if the user is an admin
  if (commandFound.name === "ban" && !admins.includes(senderId_LID)) {
    // Block the command by not calling next() and send a feedback message
    await bot.SendMsg.Text(chatId, "❌ You don't have permission to use the 'ban' command.");
    return;
  }

  // For all other commands, or if the user has permission, continue to execute the command.
  await next();
});
```

## Notes

If you don’t call `next()`, the middleware chain **_stops_**.

- In a general middleware, the message will not be processed for commands.
- In a command-specific middleware, the command's `run` method **will not be executed**.

This gives you powerful control over your bot's message and command processing flow.

# Manipulating the Chat Context

The `IChatContext` object (`ctx`) is your primary tool for interacting with a chat. By default, it's tied to the chat where a command was triggered. However, you can easily **clone** or **retarget** it to perform actions in other chats, start new conversations, or run tasks in parallel.

Here are the different ways you can manipulate the context.

---

## 1. Replying Privately to a Group Command

This is the most common and reliable way to switch from a group chat to a user's private chat.

**The Pattern:**

1.  Use the low-level API to send an "anchor" message to the user's private DM.
2.  Use `ctx.CloneButTargetedToWithInitialMsg()` and pass in the message you just sent. This creates a new, perfectly configured context for that private chat.

```typescript
import type { AdditionalAPI, CommandArgs, IChatContext, ICommand } from "whatsbotcord";

class PrivateReplyCommand implements ICommand {
  name: string = "myinfo";

  public async run(ctx: IChatContext, api: AdditionalAPI, args: CommandArgs): Promise<void> {
    // This command was run in a group. Let's reply in private.

    // 1. Send an initial "anchor" message directly to the user.
    const privateMsg = await api.InternalSocket.Send.Text(
      args.participantIdPN!, // The user's phone number ID
      "Replying privately as you requested..."
    );

    // 2. Create a new context targeted to the private chat using the message.
    const privateCtx = ctx.CloneButTargetedToWithInitialMsg({ initialMsg: privateMsg! });

    // 3. Now, all messages sent with `privateCtx` go to the user's DMs! 🤫
    await privateCtx.SendText(`Hi ${args.originalRawMsg.pushName}, here is your private info!`);
    // await privateCtx.SendImage(...);
  }
}
```

---

## 2. Starting a New Conversation from an ID

Sometimes you just have a user's or group's ID and want to start talking to them.

### Targeting a Private Chat

If you want to message a user directly and only have their ID, use `CloneButTargetedToIndividualChat`.

```typescript
import type { AdditionalAPI, CommandArgs, IChatContext, ICommand } from "whatsbotcord";

class StartPrivateChatCommand implements ICommand {
  name: string = "contactme";

  public async run(ctx: IChatContext, _api: AdditionalAPI, args: CommandArgs): Promise<void> {
    // Let's create a new context to talk to the user who ran the command.
    const privateCtx: IChatContext = ctx.CloneButTargetedToIndividualChat({
      userChatId: args.participantIdPN!, // Get the user's ID. You can send private messages only to PhoneNumbersID like. (e.g 234234234@whatsapp.es), so you can't with @lid id's
    });

    // Now we can talk to them in their private chat.
    await privateCtx.SendText("Hello! You asked me to contact you. How can I help?");
  }
}
```

### Targeting a Different Group Chat

If you need your bot to send a message to a _different_ group, use `CloneButTargetedToGroupChat`.

```typescript
import type { AdditionalAPI, CommandArgs, IChatContext, ICommand } from "whatsbotcord";

class AnnounceInAnotherGroupCommand implements ICommand {
  name: string = "announce";

  public async run(ctx: IChatContext, _api: AdditionalAPI, args: CommandArgs): Promise<void> {
    //!announce Hi this is my announcement => ["Hi", "this", "is", "my", "announcement"] => "Hi this is my announcement"
    const announcement = args.args.join(" ");
    const targetGroupId = "1234567890@g.us"; // ID of the announcements group

    // Create a new context targeted at the announcements group.
    const announcementCtx = ctx.CloneButTargetedToGroupChat({
      groupChatId: targetGroupId,
    });

    // Send the message to the other group.
    await announcementCtx.SendText(`📢 Announcement: ${announcement}`);
    await ctx.SendText("I've posted your message in the announcements group!");
  }
}
```

---

## 3. Creating a Simple Clone

If you need an identical, independent copy of the current context (for example, to run a background task without affecting your current flow), use `Clone()`.

```typescript
import type { ICommand, IChatContext, AdditionalAPI, CommandArgs } from "whatsbotcord";

class ParallelTaskCommand implements ICommand {
  name: string = "starttask";

  public async run(ctx: IChatContext, _api: AdditionalAPI, _args: CommandArgs): Promise<void> {
    await ctx.SendText("Starting a background task for you now...");

    // Create an identical, independent copy of the context.
    const clonedCtx = ctx.Clone();

    // Use the clone for a separate, long-running task.
    setTimeout(async () => {
      await clonedCtx.SendText("Background task update: Still working...");
    }, 5000); // 5 seconds later

    setTimeout(async () => {
      await clonedCtx.SendText("Background task finished! ✅");
    }, 10000); // 10 seconds later
  }
}
```

# Using AdditionalAPI & Internal Socket

Each command receives `api: AdditionalAPI` alongside `ctx`. `ctx` is the high-level, per-chat helper you will use 95% of the time. `api.InternalSocket` is the raw WhatsApp socket exposed for advanced scenarios where you need to go beyond the current chat or wire custom instrumentation.

## When to use it

- Send messages to other chats without cloning the current context (broadcasts, cross-chat replies).
- Subscribe to raw socket events for analytics/telemetry.
- Publish stories/statuses with `api.Myself.Status.UploadText(...)`.
- Use socket features not surfaced by `ChatContext` while keeping full control over parameters.

## Send to arbitrary chats

`InternalSocket.Send.*` exposes the same sugar methods as `ChatContext.Send*`, but you must pass a full WhatsApp JID:

- Private chats → `123456789@whatsapp.es` (PN).
- Groups → `123456789@g.us`.

Messages are queued safely by default; set `sendRawWithoutEnqueue: true` only when you deliberately want to bypass the safety queue.

```ts
import type { AdditionalAPI, CommandArgs, IChatContext, ICommand } from "whatsbotcord";

class Broadcast implements ICommand {
  name = "broadcast";

  async run(ctx: IChatContext, api: AdditionalAPI, args: CommandArgs): Promise<void> {
    const groups = ["123456789@g.us", "987654321@g.us"];
    const text = args.args.join(" ") || "Hello group!";

    for (const chatId of groups) {
      await api.InternalSocket.Send.Text(chatId, `📢 ${text}`);
    }

    await ctx.SendText("Sent your message to all configured groups.");
  }
}
```

## Listen to raw events

You can subscribe to socket-level events directly from the command context. Remember to unsubscribe to avoid duplicate listeners when commands run multiple times.

```ts
import type { AdditionalAPI, CommandArgs, IChatContext, ICommand } from "whatsbotcord";
import { MsgType } from "whatsbotcord";

class TapRawStream implements ICommand {
  name = "tapprobe";

  async run(ctx: IChatContext, api: AdditionalAPI, _args: CommandArgs): Promise<void> {
    const handler = (senderLID, chatId, _rawMsg, msgType) => {
      console.log(`[raw] ${chatId} from ${senderLID ?? "unknown"}:`, MsgType[msgType]);
    };

    api.InternalSocket.onIncomingMsg.Subscribe(handler);
    await ctx.SendText("Subscribed to raw incoming messages for logging.");

    // Later, if you want to stop listening:
    // api.InternalSocket.onIncomingMsg.Unsubscribe(handler);
  }
}
```

## Safety tips for InternalSocket

- Prefer `ChatContext` for single-chat flows; reach for `InternalSocket` only when you need cross-chat or low-level control.
- Always pass the correct JID suffix (`@whatsapp.es` for individuals, `@g.us` for groups) when using `Send.*`.
- Keep listeners paired with `Unsubscribe` when attaching them inside commands, especially in dev hot-reload setups.
- Use the default queued sends (no `sendRawWithoutEnqueue`) to avoid hitting WhatsApp throttling.

# WhatsBotCord.js Mocking & Testing

You can simulate a full WhatsApp command interaction locally, without ever touching your real bot obj or changing any command code!
Perfect for testing and automating responses from your commands.
To do so, import from this library **_ChatMock_** object which lets you mock a whatsapp chat environment so your command
behaves as if it's running live.

## Simplest usage

### Javascript

```js
import { it } from "your-testing-framework-of-choice";
import { ChatMock, CreateCommand } from "whatsbotcord";

const myCommand = CreateCommand(
  /** Command name */
  "mynamecommand",
  /** Code to run when called */
  async (ctx, api, args) => {
    await ctx.SendText("Hello User");
    await ctx.SendText("What's your name?");

    // Wait for user input
    const userName = await ctx.WaitText({ cancelKeywords: ["hello", "world"] }); //Returns: "chris"
    await ctx.SendText("Hello " + userName);
  },
  /** Aditional config (no alias) */
  { aliases: [] }
);

it("retrieves user input correctly", async () => {
  // Create a mock chat for the command
  const chat = new ChatMock(myCommand);

  // Simulate user sending "chris"
  chat.EnqueueIncomingText("chris");

  // Start the simulation
  await chat.StartChatSimulation();

  // Inspect results
  console.log(chat.SentFromCommand.Texts); // [{text:"Hello User"}, {text: "What's your name?"}, {text:"Hello chris"}]
  console.log(chat.WaitedFromCommand); // [{cancelKeywords:["hello","world"]}]
});
```

### Typescript

```ts
import { it } from "your-testing-framework-of-choice";
import type { AdditionalAPI, CommandArgs, IChatContext, ICommand } from "whatsbotcord";
import { ChatMock } from "whatsbotcord";

class Com implements ICommand {
  name = "mynamecommand";

  async run(ctx: IChatContext, _rawMsgApi: AdditionalAPI, _args: CommandArgs): Promise<void> {
    await ctx.SendText("Hello User");
    await ctx.SendText("What's your name?");

    // Wait for user input
    const userName = await ctx.WaitText({ cancelKeywords: ["hello", "world"] }); //Returns: "chris"
    await ctx.SendText("Hello " + userName);
  }
}

it("retrieves user input correctly", async () => {
  // Create a mock chat for the command
  const chat = new ChatMock(new Com());

  // Simulate user sending "chris"
  chat.EnqueueIncomingText("chris");

  // Start the simulation
  await chat.StartChatSimulation();

  // Inspect results
  console.log(chat.SentFromCommand.Texts); // [{text:"Hello User"}, {text: "What's your name?"}, {text:"Hello chris"}]
  console.log(chat.WaitedFromCommand); // [{cancelKeywords:["hello","world"]}]
});
```

## Advanced example

This example demonstrates full configuration and more complex interactions when mocking.

### Javascript

```js
import { describe, it } from "your-testing-framework-of-choice";
import { ChatMock, CreateCommand, MsgHelpers, MsgType, SenderType } from "whatsbotcord";

// For Javascript uses who need to create a command with intelissense help!
const myCommand = CreateCommand(
  /** Command Name */
  "command",
  /** run() command */
  async (ctx, api, args) => {
    console.log("Args:", args.args); // ["argument1", "argument2"]
    console.log("Chat ID:", ctx.FixedChatId); // "myCustomChatId!@g.us"
    console.log("Participant ID:", ctx.FixedParticipantId); // "myCustomParticipantId!@whatsapp.es"

    // Ask for user's name
    await ctx.SendText("What's your name?");
    const name = await ctx.WaitText({ timeoutSeconds: 3 });

    if (name) await ctx.SendText(`Hello ${name}. Nice to meet you`);
    else await ctx.SendText("You didn't respond in 3 seconds..");

    // Ask for favorite programming language
    await ctx.SendText("What's your favorite programming language?");
    const response = await ctx.WaitMsg(MsgType.Text);

    if (response) {
      const language = MsgHelpers.FullMsg_GetText(response);
      if (language) await ctx.SendText(`Oh, your favorite language is: ${language}`);
    } else {
      await ctx.SendText("You didn't respond in 3 seconds.");
    }
  },
  /** Optional params */
  {
    aliases: ["com"],
  }
);

    const optionalDelay = 1250; //Miliseconds
    // Simulate user responses
    chat.EnqueueIncomingText("chris", { delayMilisecondsToReponse: optionalDelay }); // Response to name question and optionally you can set how much time to respond!
    chat.EnqueueIncomingText("typescript", { delayMilisecondsToReponse: optionalDelay }); // Answering question and optionally you can set how much time to respond!

    await chat.StartChatSimulation();

## Mocking Context Behaviour

WhatsApp handles different conversation types: private chats, group chats, communities, and more.
When writing tests, you may want to mock these contexts to simulate how your commands behave.

To avoid confusion, in this documentation we’ll use:

- **_Individual Chat_** → a private one-to-one chat with a user (not a group or community channel).

- **_Group Chat_** → a multi-user group conversation (not community announcements).

### The Basics: WhatsAapp IDs

WhatsApp identifies chats and participants using specific suffixes:

#### Individual Chats

```bash
123123123@whatsapp.es
```

#### Groups

```bash
123123123@g.us
```

#### Group Members Participants (Participant)

Inside groups, participants may appear as:

- LID (Local Identifier) — modern way:

```bash
123123123@lid
```

- PN (Phone Number) — legacy way:

```bash
123123123@whatsapp.es
```

👉 Notice how all IDs end with a specific suffix that tells you what type they are.

You can freely mock these IDs to create the environment you need for testing your commands.

### Mocking behaviour

The type of chat your ChatMock creates depends on the options you pass:

1. No Options → Defaults to Individual Chat

```js
const chat = new ChatMock(new MyCommand());
```

2. Explicit Chat Type (senderType)

```js
const chat = new ChatMock(new MyCommand(), {
  /** ...(all other options) **/
  senderType: SenderType.Individual, // or SenderType.Group
});
```

Forces the mock to be the specified type.

3. Explicit Chat Id

```js
const chat = new ChatMock(new PingCommand(), {
  chatId: "yourGroupId@g.us", //or:  chatId: "yourPrivateChat@whatsapp.es"
});
```

The suffix in chatId determines whether it’s treated as an Individual or Group chat.

4. Adding Participant IDs

```js
const chat = new ChatMock(new PingCommand(), {
  /** ...(all other options) **/
  participantId_LID: "yourId",
  participantId_PN: "yourId",
});
```

Since only groups have participants, this will implicitly become a Group Chat.

5. Mixing Participant IDs + Explicit Type

```js
const chat = new ChatMock(new PingCommand(), {
  participantId_LID: "yourId",
  participantId_PN: "yourId",
  senderType: SenderType.Individual,
});
```

Even if you pass participant IDs, senderType wins and forces it to be an Individual Chat.

#### Priority Rules

When deciding chat type, the following order applies:

1. senderType → highest priority, always overrides.
2. chatId suffix → determines type if provided.
3. Participant IDs (participantId_LID or participantId_PN) → imply a Group Chat if no senderType.
4. No options → defaults to Individual Chat.

⚡ This way, you can precisely control whether your mocked context behaves like an Individual Chat or Group Chat, with or without custom participant IDs.

So, you can see your mocked data this way:

### Typescript (In js works the same)

```ts
import { it } from "your-testing-framework-of-choice";
import type { AdditionalAPI, CommandArgs, IChatContext, ICommand } from "whatsbotcord";
import { ChatMock } from "whatsbotcord";

class Com implements ICommand {
  name = "mynamecommand";
  async run(ctx: IChatContext, _rawMsgApi: AdditionalAPI, args: CommandArgs): Promise<void> {
    console.log(ctx.FixedChatId); // Default: "privateUserChatId@whatsapp.es
    console.log(ctx.FixedParticipantLID); // "yourId@lid"
    console.log(ctx.FixedParticipantPN); // "yourId@whatsapp.es"

    console.log(args.chatId); // Default: "privateUserChatId@whatsapp.es
    console.log(args.participantIdLID); // "yourId@lid"
    console.log(args.participantIdPN); // "yourId@whatsapp.es"
    console.log(args.senderType); // SenderType.Individual
    //Yes, they are the same either in ctx and args, the come from the same chat after all.
  }
}

it("retrieves user input correctly", async () => {
  const chat = new ChatMock(new PingCommand(), {
    participantId_LID: "yourId",
    participantId_PN: "yourId",
    senderType: SenderType.Individual,
  });
  await chat.StartChatSimulation();
});
```

# Documentation

Of course, chat or context object provided in commands has a lot more methods availables to send:

- Images
- Videos
- Documents
- Polls
- Ubication (Gps)

And more which are already documented in code, but I'm planning to create a small wiki or documentation page dedicated in the
future for this proyect. Soon will be available.
